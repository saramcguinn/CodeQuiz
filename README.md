# GeniusTest

This test takes the user through five questions as a timer counts down from 60 seconds. The user must answer a question correctly before they are taken to the next question. If they answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds are deducted from their remaining time. If they run out of time, they are alerted and the test starts over.

Once the test is finished, the user's score - the number of remaining seconds - is captured, and the user adds their name to a highscore list, which is ordered from highest to lowest and kept in local storage.

This assignment was extremely challenging! My tutor assisted me with simplifying the question array and the corresponding logic, and I had to look up quite a lot of content. I learned a ton about arrays, objects, and how to grab information by specifying indices of nested elements. I got good practice with for loops and if statements as well. The concept of hiding and displaying html elements using css classes was something I hadn't played with before, and I'm seeing how powerful that simple concept can be. I feel reasonably comfortable with the setInterval, clearInterval, and setTimeout methods as well as with creating elements using javascript.

Overall I am pleased with how this turned out, despite - or perhaps due to - how difficult it was and how much time it took. And I will certainly never look at simple-seeming applications like quizzes, highscore boards, or timers the same again!
